# PlanetSimulationCPP
A very small program which uses Newton's law of gravitation to simulate how planets move in space. The program's code contains two scenarios: one containing two planets of equal mass, and another containing a planet with a moon. More scenarios are definitely possible (i.e. gravitational interaction between three planets), however haven't been included in the base code.
